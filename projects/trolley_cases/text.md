Background
------------------

The trolley dilemma is a well-known thought experiment to whether peoples moral intuitions lean
more towards either deontological, or utilitarian ethics. You are to imagine a train which is about to collide
with a number of people on the track, and yourself being able to pull a lever that would divert the train onto another track where a fewer number of people would die. Persons who would not pull the lever are said to lean more towards deontological ethics.
